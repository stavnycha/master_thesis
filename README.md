scripts, which were used in a master thesis

# Baseline folder
This folder contains scripts, which were used in Section 4 "Application of Recommended Models to Fortumo Data", where existing models were applied to Fortumo data.

# Root folder

* **"actual fortumo predictive quality.R"** -  calculates actual prediction quality in Fortumo, which is described in Section 2.

* **"kmeans_clustering.R"** - calculates prediction quality of the text-based model

* **"logistic_regression_improved.R"** - calculates prediction quality of the meta-information-based model OLR without removal of outliers

* **"logistic_regression_improved_preprocessing.R"** - calculates prediction quality of the meta-information-based model OLR with removal of outliers

* **"random_forest_improved.R"** - calculates prediction quality of the meta-information-based model RF without removal of outliers

* **"random_forest_improved_preprocessing.R"** - calculates prediction quality of the meta-information-based model RF with removal of outliers
